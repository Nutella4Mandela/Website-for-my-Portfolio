# Website for my Portfolio
I made this to have a door to my skills in programming and designing. Funny enough, the designing part was probably the hardest and the 
most time consuming part for me, but it was a lot of fun to make during my college semester and I've learned a lot in both fields. Getting it all 
to work while fitting it all on my website in different devices was a new level of programming I had to learn and I'm glad I got it all to work. I 
tried to make it as simple as it can possibly be to make it easier to access my links and contacts without it being too much. If you're here 
because you came from my site, welcome! Enjoy your stay! I used ASP.Net, C#, Javascript, Aseprite, and last, but not least, CSS!

# HomePage(The only page)
The homepage starts with a Imagine Logo, then it disappears, showing the actual page with a navigational menu. Scrolling down shows more 
about who I am and what I do. Most of what I made I tried to make it interactive, having different animations and size depending on if you 
hover on the icons. I've also made my own font for the purpose of this site. If you go on the navigational menu, it gives you different options to 
choose. HOME sends you back to the top of the page, ABOUT sends you down to my introduction and what I do, PORTFOLIO sends you to my 
links, and CONTACT gives you the option to contact me.

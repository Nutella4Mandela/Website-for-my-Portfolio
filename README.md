# Website for my Portfolio
I made this to have a door to my skills in programming and designing. Funny enough, the designing part was probably the hardest and the 
most time consuming part for me, but it was a lot of fun to make during my college semester and I've learned a lot in both fields. Getting it all 
to work while fitting it all on my website in different devices was a new level of programming I had to learn and I'm glad I got it all to work. I 
tried to make it as simple as it can possibly be to make it easier to access my links and contacts without it being too much. If you're here 
because you came from my site, welcome! Enjoy your stay!

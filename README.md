# Website for my Portfolio
I made this to have a door to my skills in programming and designing. Funny enough, the designing part was probably the hardest and the 
most time consuming part for me, but it was a lot of fun to make during my college semester and I've learned a lot in both fields. Getting it all 
to work while fitting it all on my website in different devices was a new level of programming I had to learn and I'm glad I got it all to work. I 
tried to make it as simple as it can possibly be to make it easier to access my links and contacts without it being too much. If you're here 
because you came from my site, welcome! Enjoy your stay! I used ASP.Net, C#, Javascript, Aseprite, and last, but not least, CSS!

# HomePage(The only page)
The homepage starts with a Imagine Logo, then it disappears, showing the actual page with a navigational menu. Scrolling down shows more 
about who I am and what I do. Most of what I made I tried to make it interactive, having different animations and size depending on if you 
hover on the icons. I've also made my own font for the purpose of this site. If you go on the navigational menu, it gives you different options to 
choose. HOME sends you back to the top of the page, ABOUT sends you down to my introduction and what I do, PORTFOLIO sends you to my 
links, and CONTACT gives you the option to contact me.

# Biggest Challenges
My biggest challenge was probably the design aspect of my page. I had to plan what I wanted to do with my design and then animate it, which 
took forever. Then I had to adjust it so that it could fit in my site. I had made many iterations to get this all to work properly. I also had to 
animate some parts using Javascript. Then I had to fit all of that into the mobile version of my site. I had so many rough testings and hurdles I 
had to solve, but it was well worth it considering the results. CSS was probably my biggest enemy in all of this, ironically...

# Unimplemented Features
I was a little ambitious with everything I wanted to do, but I ended up trying to make it as simple as it can be. I was also at a time crunch since I 
was graduating at the time. Even if I wanted to add all of my ideas in, it just couldn't work. The first idea I wanted to implement was interaction 
with all of the objects you see here below. I ended up with only having one gif file to cram it all in since it was too ambitious of an idea. As you 
can see, there was so much going on. I couldn't plan all of it, let alone animate it and see what it does. Maybe someday when I'm not trying to 
kill myself over it. I've also wanted to make three more pages: my music page, my art page, and a blog. I then realized that it wasn't really going 
to be necessary, considering the fact that these skills weren't needed for the job that I'm looking for. As for blogs, I knew I wasn't going to 
update them regularly, to be real. And besides, who would want to check up on them? Instagram just seemed like the better contender, so I 
added that as a link.
